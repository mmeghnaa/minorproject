topic: "Why Would I Trust Your Numbers?" On the Explainability of Expected Values in Soccer

This research paper addresses the challenge of estimating the probability that a soccer shot will result in a goal, with a focus on creating a model
that can be easily explained to soccer practitioners unfamiliar with mathematics and machine learning. Inspired by prior work [Decroos and Davis, 2
019], the authors train an Explainable Boosting Machine model, known for its interpretability. The key contributions are in the representation of
shot locations and the explainability of the model.

Background: Soccer's low-scoring nature makes quantifying the impact of individual actions challenging.Various approaches have been proposed to 
distribute the reward for scoring a goal across the actions leading to the goal-scoring opportunity. Prior research has operated on both match event
data and tracking data.

Methodology: The study builds on the work of Decroos and Davis [2019], focusing on creating an Explainable Boosting Machine model for shot 
valuation.
Shot locations are represented using a feature vector reflecting a fuzzy assignment to designated zones on the pitch. The model's additiveness
allows for easy inspection and interpretation.

Conclusion and Future Work: The research achieves its goal of creating an explainable model while exhibiting similar performance to existing 
approaches. Future directions include extending the approach to value actions beyond shots, refining the representation of shot locations, and
investigating the model's robustness.


Significance: The research contributes to bridging the gap between sophisticated analytics models and the practical needs of soccer practitioners.
The proposed approach offers interpretability without compromising performance.

Limitations and Future Challenges:The paper acknowledges the need for more comprehensive comparative tests with soccer practitioners and potential
vulnerabilities to adversarial examples. The future challenge involves extending the approach to value various types of actions and refining the
representation of shot locations.
In summary, the paper successfully introduces an approach that combines accuracy and interpretability in valuing soccer shots, aiming to make
advanced analytics more accessible to soccer practitioners.
